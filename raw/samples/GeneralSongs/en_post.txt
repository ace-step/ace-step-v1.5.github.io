[Intro - Arpeggiated Electric Guitar]

[Verse 1]
Under neon lights, they flicker and fade
Lost in the hum of this restless parade
A city's heartbeat pulses in my veins
Searching for answers in the acid rain
Shadows stretch long, they're clawing my way
The night is alive but it's mine to obey

[Chorus]
Oh, shadows of neon
Where do you run?
Bleeding out the night just to make us one
Oh, shadows of neon
Tell me the truth
Are you the ghost or the one I chase with you?

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
The walls are whispering secrets they can't keep
Echoes of footsteps buried six feet deep
Every corner's a story you'll never forget
I'm tangled in chaos, dressed up as regret

[Chorus]
Oh, shadows of neon
Where do you run?
Bleeding out the night just to make us one
Oh, shadows of neon
Tell me the truth
Are you the ghost or the one I chase with you?

[Outro - Extended Guitar Solo]
[Music fades out]
