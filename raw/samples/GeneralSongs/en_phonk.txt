[Intro – whispered, distorted]
Yeah… meow…

[Verse 1]
I’m a cat with a laptop, paws on the pad
Tryna cook a beat but the beat cook me back
Hit the space bar—whoops, deleted the track
Tail hit the mouse, now the screen go black

I got nine lives, zero clue
GarageBand cryin’ like “what you do?”
Mic smell like tuna, cables in knots
Every time I rap I just knock down pots

Tryna sound hard, tryna sound mean
But I cough up hair in between sixteen
Producer said “yo, keep the tempo straight”
I sat on the keyboard, changed the key to “HISS”

[Pre-Chorus]
Lights low, bowl empty, vibes kinda sad
I wanted a hit, now I mad in my pad
Dreams of fame, but the song fell apart
So I cry in autotune from the litter box heart

[Chorus]
Meow, Purrra, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu
Meow, Purrra, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu
Meow, Purrra, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu, Miu
Meo
