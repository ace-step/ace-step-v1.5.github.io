A dramatic, cinematic rock interpretation of a classical Chinese poem, blending traditional lyrical imagery with modern electric instrumentation. The arrangement features dynamic contrasts: verses are intimate and narrative-driven with clean guitar and sparse percussion, while the chorus erupts with distorted power chords, driving drums, and expressive lead guitar mimicking the intensity of the pipa. Male vocals deliver the ancient text with gravitas, occasionally layered with ethereal backing harmonies to evoke the moonlit river scene.
