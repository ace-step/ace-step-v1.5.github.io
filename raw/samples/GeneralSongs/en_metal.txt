[Intro - Guitar Riff]

[Verse 1]
Rip the script, break it mold
Shatter chains, dare the bold
Took your crown, you can't ignore
Freedom's knock on every door

[Chorus]
Break the chains, let it pour
Shout it loud, beg no more
Burn the rules, end the war
We're alive, can't ignore
Can't ignore

[Verse 2]
Tear it down, brick by brick
Every lie, every trick
Skies on fire, won't obey
Chaos calls, don't delay

[Chorus]
Break the chains, let it pour
Shout it loud, beg no more
Burn the rules, end the war
We're alive, can't ignore
Can't ignore

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Echoes scream, hearts collide
No surrender, no divide
Wolves are howling, hear their cry
We rise up, won't comply

[Chorus]
Break the chains, let it pour
Shout it loud, beg no more
Burn the rules, end the war
We're alive, can't ignore
Can't ignore

[Outro - Guitar Riff]
[abrupt silence]
