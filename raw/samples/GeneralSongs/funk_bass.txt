[Drum Break - Vintage Drum Kit playing a tight syncopated breakbeat]
Get on up!

[Verse 1 - Slap Bass Guitar playing a fast thumb-and-pop riff]
I feel the rhythm moving in my feet
Walking down the sunny side of the street

[Chorus - Horn Section hitting sharp staccato accents on the one]
Give it up, turn it loose!
We got the funk and we got the juice!

[Bridge - Hammond B3 Organ playing percussive stabs]
Shake it down, shake it all around
