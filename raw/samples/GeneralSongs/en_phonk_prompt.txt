An aggressive, high-energy phonk track, driven by a sharp, repetitive cowbell pattern that defines the groove. Dark minor-key synths blend with Japanese-inspired instruments such as koto plucks, shamisen-style melodies, and taiko-like percussion hits, creating an eastern atmosphere layered over a gritty trap framework. The rhythm is powered by a punchy, hard-clipped drum kit and an overdriven, distorted 808 bass typical of phonk. A deep, low-pitched male vocal delivers a raw rap performance, characterized by a monotone, chant-like flow and heavy processing including saturation, phasing, distortion, and tape-style compression. Lo-fi vinyl noise, subtle pitch warble, glitchy dropouts, and abrupt beat cuts reinforce the raw Memphis aesthetic and underground phonk character.
