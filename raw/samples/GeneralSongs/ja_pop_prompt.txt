An energetic, bilingual J-pop and French pop vocal performance over a driving electronic beat. The track is built on a foundation of punchy synth bass, crisp drum machine rhythms, and layered synthesizers. A powerful female lead vocal delivers catchy melodies in Japanese, contrasted by a male rapper who performs a verse in French and English. The production is polished and modern, featuring vocal chops, synth arpeggios, and dynamic builds that lead into an anthemic, soaring chorus with layered harmonies and expressive vocal ad-libs. The song concludes with a brief, reflective spoken-word section in Japanese before fading out.
