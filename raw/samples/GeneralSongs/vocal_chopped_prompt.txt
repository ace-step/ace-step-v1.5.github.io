An energetic drum and bass track driven by heavily processed vocal chops that serve as both rhythmic and melodic hooks. The song opens with layered, pitched-up female-sounding vocal samples creating an atmospheric texture before slamming into a high-tempo breakbeat at 0:12. A powerful synth bassline underpins the driving rhythm section. The arrangement is dynamic, featuring intense build-ups where filters sweep open to create tension, followed by impactful drops that reintroduce the core groove. The vocal samples are treated as instruments rather than lyrical carriers, chopped and pitched to form catchy phrases like 'uh' and 'ah' that define the track's character.
