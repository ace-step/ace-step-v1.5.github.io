A dark ominous high energy aggressive drum and bassintro driven by heavily processed vocal chops and synth melody that serve as both rhythmic and melodic hooks. The song opens with layered, pitched-down crisp deep female-sounding vocal samples creating an atmospheric texture before slamming into a high-tempo breakbeat at 0:12. A powerful bassline underpins the driving rhythm section. The arrangement is dynamic, featuring intense build-ups where filters sweep open to create tension, soft strained haunting crisp female vocals softly sings the verse, followed by impactful drops that reintroduce the core groove. The vocal samples are treated as instruments rather than lyrical carriers, chopped and pitched to form catchy phrases like 'don't make me' and 'break'em' that define the track's character.
