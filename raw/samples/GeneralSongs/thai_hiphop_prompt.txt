A clean, melodic electric guitar loop with a slightly lo-fi, chiptune-like quality establishes the track's foundation. A punchy, straightforward drum machine beat and a subtle synth bass enter, supporting a confident male vocal performance in Thai. The delivery blends melodic rap with sung passages, maintaining a consistent, assertive tone throughout the verses and chorus. The arrangement features instrumental breaks where the guitar loop is layered with evolving synth textures and arpeggios, adding a slightly electronic depth before returning to the core vocal and guitar -driven groove.
