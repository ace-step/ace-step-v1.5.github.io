An aggressive, high-energy heavy metal track that explodes from the start with dual, heavily distorted guitars playing tight, chugging riffs over a powerful, driving drum beat. The male vocalist delivers a forceful, slightly raspy performance in a mid-to-high range, perfectly matching the song's intensity. The arrangement features a classic metal structure, highlighted by a melodic and technical guitar solo filled with fast runs and expressive bends. The production is clean yet powerful, emphasizing the punch of the drums and the sharp attack of the guitars, creating an anthemic and rebellious mood.
