A driving post-punk arrangement kicks off with layered electric guitars—one clean and arpeggiated, the other providing distorted chordal texture—over a solid bassline and powerful live drums. The male lead vocal is delivered with an angsty, strained quality that builds into an anthemic, shouted chorus where his voice cracks with emotion. Following a melodic yet noisy guitar solo filled with feedback and expressive bends, the track breaks down to its core rhythmic elements before fading out on lingering guitar noise.
