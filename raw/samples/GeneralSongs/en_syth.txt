[Intro lead hook melody with fast drum beat fades in]

[Verse - Deep bass melody with soft strained female voice]
I never asked for this, but you've got what's coming,
Brace yourself now, 'cause there's no more running.
My shadows are creeping, time to face the fate,
No more hiding, it's decided now, it's too late.

[Pre Chorus - pleading male voice movie sample] Why does it have to be this way.

[Chorus female voice] BREAK'EM Oi la la Oi la la, BREAK'EM Oi la la Oi la la

[Post Chorus female voice] It's too late, It's too late, it's too late, it's too late!

[Spoken word movie sample] LET THE BEAT DROP!!!

[Breakdown - Heavy half time trap phonk style groove]

[Pre Chorus - anguished male voice movie sample] Why does it have to be this way.

[Chorus] BREAK'EM Oi la la Oi la la, BREAK'EM Oi la la Oi la la

[Outro -
