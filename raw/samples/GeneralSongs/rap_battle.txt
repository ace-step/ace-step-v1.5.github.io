[Verse 1 - Female Vocal]
I hawk loogies that burn holes in the topographical map
You’re a bird-poop collector, a stationary squirrel trap
I swap my skin out like a stolen credit card
You’re just vertical firewood, rotting in the yard

[Verse 2 - Male Vocal]
I got beetle larvae digging trenches in my side older than you
You’re a wet balloon with a ribbit and a high IQ?
I drink groundwater filtered through sixty feet of dirt
You look like a green booger wiped on a flannel shirt

[Chorus - Duet]
Magic mucus meets the hardwood floor
One breaks the laws of physics, the other is a bore
Sawdust and spells, the clash of the swamp
One gets chopped for lumber, the other gets the stomp

[Verse 3 - Female Vocal]
I pull gold coins from the ears of flies, I defy the grid
You’ve been standing in that same spot since you were a kid
I’m slippery, chaotic, a glitch in the biological code
You’re just waiting for a lost dog to relieve his load

[Verse 4 - Male Vocal]
I’m forty percent cellulose and sixty percent hate
You’re a snack for a largemouth bass, simply bait
Keep your wizardry, I have vascular strength and thick skin
You’re a squishy little mistake destined for the bin

[Outro]
