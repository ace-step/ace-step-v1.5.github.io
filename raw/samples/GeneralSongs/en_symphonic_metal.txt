[Intro – Orchestral strings swelling into a heavy, marching rhythm with operatic backing choirs]

[Verse 1 – Female Vocal – Soprano, haunting and clear]
I see you walking through the ash and the grey
A king without a kingdom, lost in the fray
The stars have turned their backs on your holy crusade
Now you stand before the mess that you made

[Verse 2 – Male Vocal – Baritone, gritty and weary]
I hear your voice inside the howl of the wind
A siren calling out the weight of my sin
My armor is shattered, my banner is torn
I curse the very hour that I was born

[Pre-Chorus – Call and Response]
[Female Vocal] Surrender the ghost, let the darkness in
[Male Vocal] I’m fighting a war that I cannot win
[Duet] The hourglass breaks, let the ritual begin

[Chorus – Duet – Anthemic, soaring harmonies over double-bass drums and symphonic layers]
We stand upon the edge of the night
Between the shadow and the dying light
The heavens fall, the earth divides
There is no shelter, nowhere left to hide
(Nowhere left to hide)

[Verse 3 – Female Vocal – Soft, seductive, building to power]
Why do you struggle when the end is so sweet?
Lay down your sword and bow at my feet
The void is a mother who welcomes you home
You were never meant to face this alone

[Verse 4 – Male Vocal – Aggressive, regaining strength]
You offer me peace but your hands are cold
I won’t sell my soul for your glitter and gold
If I have to burn, then I’ll burn like the sun
My final battle has only begun

[Bridge – Duet – Dramatic, tense build; orchestral swells to a near-crescendo, choirs fading to a whisper]
[Female Vocal] The gods have abandoned their broken creation
No prayer unspoken, no absolution
Your fire will fade, your resolve will bend
The dark is eternal, the light has an end
[Male Vocal] My fire may fade but my heart still rages
No chain can bind me, no cage can cage this
I’ll carve my name in the ashes and stone
I’ll fight till my last breath, I’ll fight alone
[Duet – Building, strings crashing, drums thundering]
We are the storm in the calm, the thorn in the rose
The blood in the soil, the fire in the cold
No fate can break us, no shadow can hold
We rise from the ashes, we stand, we unfold

[Pre-Chorus – Call and Response, amplified; operatic choirs blaring, full orchestral force]
The hourglass breaks, let the ritual begin

[Chorus – Duet – Explosive, soaring peak; double-bass drums pounding, symphonic layers crashing, choirs belting in harmony]
We stand upon the edge of the night
Between the shadow and the dying light
The heavens fall, the earth divides
There is no shelter, nowhere left to hide
We tear through the dark, we ignite the sky
We burn through the silence, we fight, we survive
The heavens fall, the earth divides
There is no shelter, nowhere left to hide
(Nowhere left to hide)

[Outro – Orchestral fade; choirs softening to a hum, strings winding down, a single piano note lingering. Male vocal whisper, female vocal echo.]
[Orchestral strings fade to black, a final drum thud cutting the silence]
