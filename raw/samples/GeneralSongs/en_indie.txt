[Intro - Plucked Synth Melody]

[Verse 1]
The sun melts over the endless plain
A mirage dances like a golden chain
Bare feet trace stories in the cracked dry land
Who holds the map in this empty game?

[Chorus]
Desert echoes
They call my name
Drums of the earth, they beat the same
Step to the rhythm, no one to blame
Desert echoes
Desert echoes

[Instrumental Break - Plucked Synth Melody]

[Verse 2]
A lone wind whispers secrets untold
Stars blink brighter than the city's gold
My shadow stretches long in the moonlit fold
This is my world, fierce and bold

[Bridge]
Do you hear it? The silence screams
Did you see it? The shifting dreams
[Vocal chop: 'dreams']

[Chorus]
Desert echoes
They call my name
Drums of the earth, they beat the same
Step to the rhythm, no one to blame
Desert echoes

[Plucked synth melody fades out]
