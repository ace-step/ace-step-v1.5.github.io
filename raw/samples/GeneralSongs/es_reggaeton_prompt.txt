A modern reggaeton track with a strong flamenco influence, opening with a pitched and chopped vocal sample melody over a classic dembow beat. A clear, confident female vocal enters, singing in Spanish with a touch of reverb. The arrangement is built on a deep sub-bass, crisp drum machine percussion, and a distinctive plucked synth guitar riff that carries the main melodic hook. The chorus elevates the energy with layered vocals and a more intense delivery. The track breaks down into a more atmospheric bridge with filtered, introspective vocals before returning to the full chorus and concluding with a sparse, whispered outro that fades to silence.
