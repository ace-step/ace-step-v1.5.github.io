[Intro - Arpeggiated Electric Guitar]

[Verse 1]
Shadows whisper secrets low
In the night where dreams won't go
Haunted by the ghost of you
Lost in echoes breaking through

[Chorus]
Eclipse heart, a fading light
Lost in darkness of the night
Holding on to pieces of us
In this nightmare's tender trust

[Verse 2]
Silence screams beneath the stars
Drowning out these distant scars
Phantom love, a bitter cup
Afraid to wake and face it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Whispers linger in the haze
'Neath the moonlit, gothic gaze
Love decays in whispered lines
Dancing shadows intertwine

[Chorus]
Eclipse heart, a fading light
Lost in darkness of the night
Holding on to pieces of us
In this nightmare's tender trust

[Bridge]
Twisted fate and broken ties
Heartbeat fading slow goodbyes
In your eyes I see the end
But I'll love you once again

[Outro - Instrumental]
[Guitar and synths fade out]
