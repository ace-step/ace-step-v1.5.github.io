[verse]
In a sliver of moonlight
A shadow man saw the light
and turned to what's right
in the dark

[verse]
in the dark
he walks forward from his hell
in his face you could tell
he comes from oh blivian


[chorus]
all is as it seems
we haunt each other's dreams
with no hate no fear
we pull each other near
in the dark

[verse]
in the inky black 
the shadow man won't pull back
he continues on his track
escaping from oh blivian

[bridge]
when you see him manifest
exist by someone's unrest
the universe has split
emotions no longer sit
in the dark

[chorus]
all can be what it seems
we haunt each other's dreams
we can escape the scene
we are becoming clean
in the dark


[verse]
we all seek the same thing
deep feelings unseen
we all want to escape
the oh blivian

[chorus]
all is as it seems
we haunt each other's dreams
with no love no zest
there will be no rest
in the dark
