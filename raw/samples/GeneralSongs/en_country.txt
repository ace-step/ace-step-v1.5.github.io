[Intro - Acoustic Guitar]

[Verse 1]
Found you standing in the river's roar
Heartbeats racing like never before
Eyes met mine and time stood still
Dreams were spinning 'round this hill
Walking barefoot on a dusty road
Fingers tracing where the pelo grow
Hear your laugh, it's a sweet melody
Love a tune that sets me free

[Chorus]
I'll ride these heartstrings all night long
Sing our song where we belong
In the quiet moments where we're strong
Your heartbeat's my favorite song

[Instrumental Break - Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 2]
Stars above us start to glow
Evening whispers, soft and low
Underneath the moonlit sky
We're just two souls, you and I
In the silence, hearts will find their tune
Underneath the prairie moon

[Instrumental Break - Acoustic Guitar]

[Bridge]
I'll ride those heartstrings 'til they stray
We'll find our way back someday

[Chorus]
I'll ride these heartstrings all night long
Sing our song where we belong
In the quiet moments where we're strong
Your heartbeat's my favorite song

[Outro - Harmonica and Guitar]
[Final guitar strum]
