An emotive Arabic folk song beginning with a virtuosic, melancholic oud solo, soon joined by an expressive violin playing in harmony. A steady, mid-tempo groove is established by hand percussion, likely a darbuka and riq. A warm, clear male vocal enters, delivering a heartfelt melody with characteristic Arabic ornamentation. The arrangement features instrumental breaks where the oud and violin engage in intricate, improvisational-sounding solos. The track builds to a dynamic instrumental section with rapid, cascading runs from the oud and violin before concluding with a final, resonant oud chord.
