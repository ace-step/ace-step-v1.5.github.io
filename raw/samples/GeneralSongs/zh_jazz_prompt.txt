A smooth, jazzy lo-fi hip-hop track built on a foundation of a gentle piano melody and a relaxed, steady drum machine groove. A warm, round bassline provides a solid harmonic base. The song features a duet between a clear, melodic female vocalist and a smooth, conversational male vocalist who trade verses and harmonize beautifully in the choruses. The arrangement is punctuated by tasteful, melodic saxophone fills that enhance the jazzy, late-night atmosphere. The track concludes with an extended instrumental outro where the saxophone takes center stage with an expressive, improvisational solo over the core piano and rhythm section, before fading out with a final, lingering piano chord and a soft whoosh effect.
