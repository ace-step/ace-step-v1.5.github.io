Midnight talks with my regrets,
Whiskey lips and cigarettes.
Promises like shattered glass,
Cut me deep but never last.

I danced with fire, played the fool,
Broke the rules and called it cool.
Now the mirror wont lie
I dont recognize these eyes.

I was right, I was left
Caught between the lines, no regrets
I was wrong, I was left behind
Like a shadow fading with the light

I've been up, but mostly down
Chasing dreams that hit the ground
Every high just slips away
Leaving echoes of my name

I was right, I was left,
Torn in two with every step.
I was wrong, I was left behind,
Another love I couldnt find.

Ive been up, but mostly down,
Chasing highs that let me drown.
I was right, I was left,
Now Im at a new low.

Silent screams, a crowded room,
Laughing loud to hide the bruise.
You said "forever," but it bends,
Til "goodbye" is how it ends.

I built a castle out of dust,
Leaned on love I couldnt trust.
Now the ashes taste like smoke,
Another joke I didnt know.

I was strong, I was weak
Fighting battles I can't repeat
I was lost, then I was found
But the silence is the loudest sound

I've been up, but mostly down
Painted smiles hide my frown
Every step feels like the past
Running fast but never last

I was right, I was left,
Torn in two with every step.
I was wrong, I was left behind,
Another love I couldnt find.

Ive been up, but mostly down,
Chasing highs that let me drown.
I was right, I was left,
Now Im at a new low.

One more drink to numb the pain,
One more name I cant erase.
Funny how the fall feels slow
Now Im at a new low.

Ne lo, ne lo, ne lo ooh
Whispered words I used to know
Ne lo, ne lo, ne lo ooh
Love just comes and love just goes

Maybe one day Ill be free
From the chains of memory
Till then, Ill sing it low
Nelo, nelo, ne lo

I was right, I was left,
Torn in two with every step.
I was wrong, I was left behind,
Another love I couldnt find.

Ive been up, but mostly down,
Chasing highs that let me drown.
I was right, I was left,
Now Im at a new low.

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up, but mostly down

I've been right; I've been left
I've been wrong; I've been left behind
I've been up, but mostly down

I was right I was left
I was wrong I was left behind
Ive been up but mostly down.
